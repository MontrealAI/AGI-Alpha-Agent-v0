# α-AGI Insight v1

This directory hosts the static α‑AGI Insight demo used in the documentation. Build the docs with `mkdocs build` and open `alpha_agi_insight_v1/index.html` from the generated `site/` folder. To preview the files directly from the repository, run:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory docs/alpha_agi_insight_v1 8000
```

and navigate to <http://localhost:8000/>. Direct `file://` access is unsupported due to browser security restrictions. You can also visit the [hosted page](https://montreal-ai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/).

For details on publishing the site automatically, see [HOSTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md](../HOSTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
