# Insight WASM LLM Assets

The Insight browser demo bundles its offline LLM runtime under
`docs/alpha_agi_insight_v1/assets/wasm_llm/`. That directory is populated by the
Insight browser build tooling and contains the WebAssembly model weights, glue
code, and metadata required to run the offline inference path.

For the full asset manifest and update workflow, refer to the source README that
ships with the assets:

- [`docs/alpha_agi_insight_v1/assets/wasm_llm/README.md`](assets/wasm_llm/README.md)
