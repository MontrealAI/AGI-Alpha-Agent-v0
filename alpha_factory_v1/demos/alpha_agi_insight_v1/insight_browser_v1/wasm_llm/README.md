# wasm-gpt2

This folder is intentionally empty. During development the lightweight `wasm-gpt2` model (~124Â MB) should be placed here and pinned to IPFS. The build script copies the contents of this directory to `dist/wasm_llm/` so the demo can load the model offline.

To fetch the model automatically, run `npm run fetch-assets` or `python ../../../../scripts/fetch_assets.py`. The script downloads `wasm-gpt2.tar` from IPFS using CID `bafybeihdwdcefgh4dqkjv67uzcmw7ojee6xedzdetojuzjevtenxquvyku` which is accessible via the gateway:
