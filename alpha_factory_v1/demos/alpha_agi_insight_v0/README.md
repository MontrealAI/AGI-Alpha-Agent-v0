# Œ±‚ÄëAGI Insight¬†üëÅÔ∏è‚ú® ‚Äî Beyond Human Foresight ‚Äî Official Demo

The **Œ±‚ÄëAGI Insight** demo predicts which industry sector is most likely to be
transformed by Artificial General Intelligence. It runs a small
**Meta‚ÄëAgentic Tree Search** (MATS) over a list of sector names. No external
 data is required so the script executes fully offline.  Pass a custom sector
 list with ``--sectors`` to experiment with your own domains. When the argument
 points to a text file, each non-empty line is treated as a sector name.

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.insight_demo --episodes 5
```

## Usage

The command line interface mirrors the options of the general MATS demo:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.insight_demo \
    --episodes 10 \
    --rewriter openai \
    --model gpt-4o \
    --log-dir logs \
    --sectors Finance,Healthcare,Energy
```

When optional dependencies such as ``openai`` or ``anthropic`` are not
installed, the program automatically falls back to a simple offline rewriter so
the demo remains functional anywhere.  Episode scores are printed to the console
and optionally written to ``scores.csv`` when ``--log-dir`` is supplied.

## OpenAI Agents Bridge

Launch ``openai_agents_bridge.py`` to control the demo via the
`openai-agents` runtime and optionally the Google ADK A2A protocol:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.openai_agents_bridge --verify-env
```
The bridge automatically falls back to offline mode when the optional
packages or API keys are missing.
