# React Web Client

This directory contains a small React interface built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
It lets you configure simulations, view results and stream live logs from the
FastAPI server.

## Setup

```bash
cd src/interface/web_client
npm install
npm run dev       # start the development server
npm run build     # build production assets in `dist/`
```

A basic smoke test simply runs `npm test`, which exits successfully if the
project dependencies are installed.
