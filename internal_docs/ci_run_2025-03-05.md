# CI status snapshot (2025-03-05)

This run captures the latest status of the GitHub Actions pipelines after checking the public badges. The `pr-ci.yml` and `smoke.yml` workflows are green, while the most recent `ci.yml` matrix run is still pending.

## Commands executed

```
python scripts/check_ci_status.py --once --workflow ci.yml --workflow pr-ci.yml --workflow smoke.yml
python scripts/check_ci_status.py --wait-minutes 10 --pending-grace-minutes 10 --workflow ci.yml --workflow pr-ci.yml --workflow smoke.yml
```

## Observations

- `pr-ci.yml` → success (completed)
- `smoke.yml` → success (completed)
- `ci.yml` → pending at https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/runs/19711149786 (branch `main`, sha `c70a26b2fdd93885e67ffc0814b5f64997cb458a`).

The long wait confirmed the run remained queued/in-progress for more than ten minutes. Re-run the `ci.yml` workflow or wait for the current run to finish to refresh the badge and unblock required checks.
